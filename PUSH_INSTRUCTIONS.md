# Push Instructions - CI/CD Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The `webidl-conversions` error has been resolved. The issue was in `setupTests.ts` where we tried to access `window.HTMLMediaElement` before the jsdom environment was initialized.

## 📦 Files Changed
1. `src/setupTests.ts` - Added window existence check
2. `vite.config.ts` - Fixed test configuration
3. `CI_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Updated documentation

## 🚀 Push These Changes

Run these commands from your local machine:

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "fix: resolve webidl-conversions error in CI tests

- Add window existence check in setupTests.ts
- Fix setupFiles path to relative in vite.config.ts
- Add pool configuration for better test isolation
- Tests now pass locally and should pass in CI"

# Push to your branch
git push origin <your-branch-name>
# Or if you're on main:
# git push origin main
```

## 🔍 Verify CI Pipeline

1. Go to: https://github.com/nakshatra207/Mathpati/actions
2. Find your latest workflow run
3. All checks should now pass ✅

Expected results:
- ✅ Test & Lint: PASS
- ✅ Security Scan: PASS
- ✅ Build and Test: PASS
- ✅ Docker Build: Will run on main/develop
- ✅ Deploy: Will run on main

## 🧪 Already Verified Locally

```bash

## 🎯 Summary

The CI/CD pipeline will now work correctly because:
1. Tests check for window existence before accessing it
2. Test configuration uses proper paths and isolation
3. All builds complete successfully
4. No more `webidl-conversions` errors
